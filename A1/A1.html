<h1>A1 Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>

<h2>Dataset Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This report explores the dataset <code>fatal_selected_clean.csv</code>, which contains records of accidental deaths 
  in Allegheny County. The dataset includes key fields such as age, incident_zip, case_year, and death_date_and_time. 
  Invalid ZIP codes were removed, and small inconsistencies between case_year and death_date_and_time were noted.
</p>

<h2>Initial Analysis Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>What is the distribution of deaths across different ages?</li>
  <li>How are accidental deaths distributed across different ZIP codes?</li>
  <li>How have death cases changed over time?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

<h3>Q1: Age Distribution</h3>
<div id="q1a"></div>
<p>Figure 1. Distribution of deaths by exact age.</p>
<p>The graph shows that the distribution of accidental drug deaths is roughly normal, 
  with most cases concentrated between ages 24 and 63. 
  The counts around ages 34 and 51 are noticeably higher than other ages. 
  This may connect to higher medication use in young adulthood and more social activity during these years, 
  which could increase drug risks.</p>

<h3>Q2: ZIP Distribution</h3>
<div id="q2"></div>
<p>Figure 2. Top 10 ZIP codes by number of deaths.</p>
<p>The chart indicates that ZIP 15210 reports the highest number of accidental deaths. 
  Both 15210 and 15212 stand out compared to other areas. 
  Such differences may be linked to population density, 
  urbanization, or local economic conditions.</p>

<h3>Q3: Time Trend</h3>
<div id="q3"></div>
<p>Figure 3. Deaths over time (based on death_date_and_time).</p>
<p>From 2007 to 2023, the trend in accidental deaths moves upward, 
  with a clear peak around 2015â€“2017. 
  After 2023, a sharp decline appears. 
  These temporal changes may relate to drug prevalence patterns, 
  while the recent decline could also be influenced by the global pandemic.</p>

<h2>Data Quality Note</h2>
<p>Some ZIP code values were invalid and were removed during preprocessing. 
  Small inconsistencies were also found between case_year and death_date_and_time, 
  but they were considered reasonable and did not affect the overall analysis.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  The analysis shows that deaths are concentrated among middle-aged adults, a few ZIP codes report disproportionately 
  high cases, and temporal patterns reveal year-to-year changes. Limitations include the lack of socioeconomic context 
  for ZIP codes.</p>
